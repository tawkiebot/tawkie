## Before and After

## Common Prompt Failures

| Failure | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too much output | Add "in 3 bullet points" or similar constraint |
| Wrong format | Be explicit: "in JSON" or "as a table" |
| Missed context | Specify what to include: "with timestamps" or "with owner names" |
| Jumbled order | Add ordering: "in priority order" or "reverse chronological" |
