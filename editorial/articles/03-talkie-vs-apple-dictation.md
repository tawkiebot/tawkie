# Talkie vs Apple Dictation for Daily Workflows

## Where Apple Dictation Wins

**Speed to first use:** It's already on your Mac. Hotkey, speak, done. No account, no installation, no configuration.

**Simplicity:** You get text. That's it. No learning curve, no features to discover, no automation to break.

**Reliability:** Apple maintains it. Updates happen in the background. It doesn't have bad days.

**Use cases:**
- Quick Slack messages
- Short notes
- Occasional dictation when hands are occupied
- Users who want "it just works"

## Where Talkie Wins

**Structured outputs:** You speak, you get JSON, Markdown, or formatted text—not just raw characters.

```apple
# Apple Dictation
"email sarah proposal by friday" → "email sarah proposal by friday"

# Talkie
"email sarah proposal by friday" → {"task": "email sarah proposal", "due": "2026-02-14", "priority": "high"}
```

**Automation integration:** Outputs go somewhere. Notion, Linear, webhooks, databases. Your voice becomes an API trigger.

**Workflow templates:** Pre-built patterns for common tasks (meeting notes → action items, voice → ticket).

**Use cases:**
- Structured capture (tasks, tickets, database entries)
- Automation-heavy workflows
- Multi-step processes triggered by voice
- Teams that need consistent output formats

## Privacy: A Closer Look

Both run locally on your Mac. Neither sends audio to the cloud for processing.

**Apple Dictation:** Uses on-device speech recognition for recent macOS versions. Earlier versions sent audio to Apple servers.

**Talkie:** Fully local. No network calls for transcription. All processing happens on your machine.

If privacy is the concern, both are fine. The difference is in what happens after transcription.

## Recommendation by Workload

| Workload | Recommended Tool | Reason |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Occasional Slack/Notes | Apple Dictation | No setup required |
| High-volume capture | Talkie | Automation saves hours |
| Structured data entry | Talkie | JSON/Markdown outputs |
| Teams with workflows | Talkie | Integration and templates |
| Simple text needs | Apple Dictation | Lower complexity |

---

## The Real Difference

Apple Dictation is a transcription tool. Talkie is a workflow tool that happens to use voice.

If you need words on a page, Apple Dictation is sufficient. If you need captured information to go somewhere and do something, Talkie justifies the 2-minute setup.
